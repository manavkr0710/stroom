# MongoDB Atlas Security - IP Access Configuration

## Current Configuration
- Currently allowing all IP addresses (`0.0.0.0/0`) to connect to MongoDB Atlas
- This is not recommended for production applications with sensitive data

## More Secure Configuration Options

### Option 1: Use Heroku's IP Ranges
Heroku uses specific IP ranges for outbound traffic. Add these to your MongoDB Atlas whitelist instead of `0.0.0.0/0`:

```
23.21.0.0/16
23.22.0.0/16  
23.23.0.0/16
50.16.0.0/15
50.19.0.0/16
52.3.0.0/16
52.4.0.0/14
52.20.0.0/14
52.54.0.0/15
52.70.0.0/15
52.86.0.0/15
52.200.0.0/13
54.156.0.0/14
54.80.0.0/13
54.224.0.0/15
54.196.0.0/15
54.221.0.0/16
54.226.0.0/15
54.234.0.0/15
54.242.0.0/15
54.161.0.0/16
54.236.0.0/15
54.162.0.0/15
54.172.0.0/15
```

These ranges may change over time. Check Heroku's documentation for the latest information.

### Option 2: Use MongoDB Atlas Private Link (Most Secure)
For paid plans, MongoDB Atlas offers Private Link for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, allowing secure private connections between Heroku and MongoDB without exposing your database to the public internet.

### Option 3: Use a VPN or Fixed IP Proxy (Advanced)
Set up a VPN or proxy with a fixed IP address that connects to your MongoDB, and configure your application to route MongoDB traffic through this proxy.

## How to Update Your MongoDB Atlas IP Whitelist

1. Log in to MongoDB Atlas at https://cloud.mongodb.com
2. Select your cluster
3. Click on "Network Access" in the left sidebar
4. Edit your current entry (`0.0.0.0/0`) or add new IP addresses/ranges
5. Click "Confirm" for each entry

## Security Best Practices

1. Use strong, unique passwords for database accounts
2. Implement database user roles with least privilege principles 
3. Enable MongoDB auditing if available on your plan
4. Regularly rotate credentials
5. Monitor database access logs for unusual activity
